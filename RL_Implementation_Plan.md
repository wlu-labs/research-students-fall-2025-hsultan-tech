## **ACTION PLAN** (Next 2 Weeks)

### **Phase 1: Core RL Setup** **START HERE**
1. **Data Pipeline** (2 days)
2. **Simple RL Environment** (2 days) 
3. **Basic RL Agent** (3 days)
4. **Training Loop** (2 days)
5. **Initial Experiments** (5 days)

## **DECISION MATRIX: What to Implement**

### **1. RL Algorithm Choice** 
| Algorithm | Pros | Cons | Recommendation |
|-----------|------|------|----------------|
| **DQN** | Simple, proven, discrete actions | Can be unstable, exploration issues | **Skip for now** |
| **PPO** | Stable, good exploration, SOTA | More complex implementation | **RECOMMENDED** |
| **A3C** | Parallel training, efficient | Complex multi-threading | **Too complex initially** |

**DECISION: Start with PPO**
- Most stable for navigation tasks
- Good balance of performance vs complexity
- Easy to debug and iterate

### **2. State Representation** (What the agent "sees")
| Option | Complexity | Performance | Implementation Time |
|--------|------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Raw RGB** | Low | Poor | 1 day |
| **Pre-trained CNN Features** | Medium | Good | 2 days |
| **Multi-modal (Vision+Text)** | High | Excellent | 5+ days |

**DECISION: Start with Pre-trained CNN Features**
- Use ResNet-50 pre-trained on ImageNet
- Extract 2048-dim features from RGB images
- Add simple text encoding later

### **3. Action Space** (How the agent moves)
| Actions | Pros | Cons | Best For |
|---------|------|------|----------|
| **4 Actions**: [Forward, Left, Right, Stop] | Simple, matches R2R | Limited movement | **START HERE** |
| **8 Actions**: + Backward, Turn Around, etc. | More flexible | Complex learning | Later iteration |
| **Continuous**: Velocity control | Most realistic | Very hard to learn | Advanced research |

**DECISION: 4 Discrete Actions**
```python
ACTION_SPACE = {
    0: "FORWARD",     # Move to next viewpoint
    1: "TURN_LEFT",   # Rotate 30° left
    2: "TURN_RIGHT",  # Rotate 30° right  
    3: "STOP"         # End episode
}
```

### **4. Reward Function** (How to train the agent)
**RECOMMENDED: Start Simple, Then Enhance**

#### **Phase 1: Basic Distance Reward** (Week 1)
```python
def simple_reward(current_pos, goal_pos, action):
    distance_before = calculate_distance(prev_pos, goal_pos)
    distance_after = calculate_distance(current_pos, goal_pos)
    
    # Basic distance-based reward
    if action == STOP:
        return 10.0 if distance_after < 3.0 else -10.0
    else:
        return -(distance_after - distance_before)  # Closer = positive
```

#### **Phase 2: Enhanced Reward** (Week 2)
```python
def enhanced_reward(state, action, info):
    # 1. Distance component
    distance_reward = calculate_distance_reward(state)
    
    # 2. Path following component  
    path_reward = 1.0 if on_optimal_path(state) else -0.5
    
    # 3. Step penalty (encourage efficiency)
    step_penalty = -0.01
    
    return distance_reward + path_reward + step_penalty
```

## **CONCRETE IMPLEMENTATION STEPS**

### **Step 1: Environment Setup** (Day 1-2)
```python
# File: src/models/r2r_environment.py
class R2REnvironment:
    def __init__(self, data_path):
        # Load R2R dataset
        # Load RGB images
        # Initialize viewpoint graph
        
    def reset(self, episode_id):
        # Return: (rgb_image, instruction, start_viewpoint)
        
    def step(self, action):
        # Return: (next_image, reward, done, info)
        
    def calculate_reward(self, state, action):
        # Distance-based reward function
```

### **Step 2: Simple RL Agent** (Day 3-5)
```python
# File: src/models/ppo_agent.py
class SimplePPOAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        # CNN feature extractor (ResNet-50)
        # Policy network: features → action probabilities
        # Value network: features → state value
        
    def get_action(self, state):
        # Return action and log probability
        
    def update(self, states, actions, rewards):
        # PPO update step
```

### **Step 3: Training Loop** (Day 6-7)
```python
# File: src/models/train_ppo.py
def train_ppo_agent():
    env = R2REnvironment(data_path)
    agent = SimplePPOAgent()
    
    for episode in range(num_episodes):
        state = env.reset()
        episode_reward = 0
        
        while not done:
            action = agent.get_action(state)
            next_state, reward, done, info = env.step(action)
            # Store transition
            state = next_state
            episode_reward += reward
            
        # Update agent every N episodes
        if episode % update_frequency == 0:
            agent.update(stored_transitions)
```

## **EVALUATION METRICS** (What to Track)

### **Phase 1 Metrics** (Week 1)

- **Episode Length**: Steps taken before stopping
- **Success Rate**: % episodes ending within 3m of goal
- **Training Stability**: Reward variance over time

### **Phase 2 Metrics** (Week 2)  
- **Navigation Error**: Distance to goal when stopping
- **Path Efficiency**: Actual path length vs optimal
- **Instruction Following**: Qualitative assessment
- **Convergence Speed**: Episodes to reach stable performance

## **POTENTIAL ISSUES & SOLUTIONS**

- **Solution**: Add intermediate rewards for progress
- **Code**: Dense reward shaping based on distance

### **Issue 2: Large Action Space**
- **Problem**: Hard to explore all viewpoints  
- **Solution**: Curriculum learning (start with short paths)
- **Code**: Filter episodes by path length initially

### **Issue 3: Overfitting to Training Data**
- **Problem**: Agent memorizes specific paths
- **Solution**: Strong validation split, regularization
- **Code**: Dropout in networks, early stopping

### **Issue 4: Slow Training**
- **Problem**: Large images, complex environment
- **Solution**: Parallel environments, efficient data loading
- **Code**: Use DataLoader with multiple workers

## **IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE**

**WEEK 1**: Implement Steps 1-3 above
1. **Day 1-2**: Build R2R environment wrapper
2. **Day 3-4**: Implement basic PPO agent  
3. **Day 5-7**: Create training loop and run first experiments

**WEEK 2**: Test and iterate
1. **Day 8-10**: Debug training issues and optimize performance
2. **Day 11-12**: Add enhanced reward function
3. **Day 13-14**: Run validation experiments and collect metrics

**Focus on getting something working end-to-end**, even if simple. Once I have a basic RL agent navigating (even poorly), I can iterate and improve rapidly.

**Key Philosophy**: Start simple, make it work, then make it better. Don't try to implement everything at once - build incrementally and validate each component.

Once the implementation code is complete, I will have a complete working RL system ready for immediate experimentation and iteration.
